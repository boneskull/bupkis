## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the Bupkis assertion library, I need to benchmark the `valueToSchema()` function directly to identify performance bottlenecks in its implementation, so that I can optimize slow code paths and ensure the function performs efficiently across different input types and configurations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the benchmark suite is configured for `valueToSchema()`, **When** I run the benchmark with various input types (primitives, objects, arrays, nested structures), **Then** I receive detailed performance metrics showing execution time and throughput for each input category.

2. **Given** the benchmark is running with different `ValueToSchemaOptions` combinations, **When** the benchmark completes, **Then** I can see which option combinations cause performance degradation.

3. **Given** the benchmark has executed with complex nested data structures, **When** I review the results, **Then** I can identify at what nesting depth or complexity level performance significantly degrades.

4. **Given** the benchmark results show performance outliers, **When** I examine the detailed metrics, **Then** I can pinpoint specific value types or patterns that cause bottlenecks.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when benchmarking circular reference detection (values with circular references)?
- How does the benchmark handle very deep nesting scenarios that approach the `maxDepth` limit?
- What performance characteristics emerge when testing with very large objects or arrays?
- How does benchmark behavior change with different `ValueToSchemaOptions` that significantly alter execution paths?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated benchmark suite specifically for the `valueToSchema()` function
- **FR-002**: System MUST test performance across different value types (primitives, objects, arrays, functions, built-in types)
- **FR-003**: System MUST measure performance with various `ValueToSchemaOptions` combinations to identify option-specific bottlenecks
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate test data that exercises different complexity levels (simple values, nested structures, large objects)
- **FR-005**: System MUST report execution time, throughput (operations per second), and memory usage metrics
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify performance outliers and flag significantly slow operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate with the existing benchmark infrastructure in the `bench/` directory
- **FR-008**: System MUST test performance characteristics across different nesting depths up to the `maxDepth` limit
- **FR-009**: System MUST benchmark circular reference detection scenarios [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this include intentionally circular objects or focus on the detection mechanism overhead?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide comparative performance data between different input categories [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we compare against baseline measurements or just relative performance between categories?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **ValueToSchemaBenchmarkSuite**: Represents the benchmark configuration and execution engine for testing `valueToSchema()` performance across various inputs and options
- **PerformanceMetrics**: Contains execution time, throughput, memory usage, and statistical data for benchmark runs
- **TestDataGenerator**: Produces various types of test values (primitives, objects, arrays, nested structures) with different complexity levels for comprehensive performance testing
- **BenchmarkResult**: Encapsulates performance measurements for specific input types, option combinations, and complexity levels, enabling bottleneck identification
