# Property Test Configurations

This directory contains configuration for property tests.

The test files in the parent directory use these configs and hand them to `@bupkis/property-testing` to run the tests.

These configs are exported so that they can be consumed by the [fuzzer](../../../scripts/fuzz.ts).
